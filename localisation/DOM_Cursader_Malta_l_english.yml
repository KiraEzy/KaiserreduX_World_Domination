MLTWD_Call_the_pope:0 "The Order Remains"
MLTWD_Call_the_pope_desc:0 "A new crusader era has come, and it is under the wings of our own saint order of John"
MLTWD_harken_to_peoples_crusade:0 "A Call to Arms Louder than Peter the Hermit's"
MLTWD_harken_to_peoples_crusade_desc:0 "During the First Crusade, perhaps no one was better at recruiting Catholics to take the Cross then Peter the Hermit. While Peter's so-called People's Crusade was an unorganized rabble that caused mass devastation and committed horrible atrocities, his ability to even win such an army with nothing more than his words is something admirable. Taking from this legacy, the Grandmaster and the leaders of other Orders we have already won over, shall begin a similar speaking campaign, aiming to get as many people to join our Crusade as possible. To make this even easier, a new Order, the Military Order of Blessed Urban II shall be created. This new Order shall act as a new 'mass Order,' where anyone of any rank can join, and take up Arms to reclaim Jerusalem. This new Order shall no doubt win many a person to our side, allowing our numbers to grow ever larger as we prepare to reclaim the Holy Land."

MLTWD_honor_our_lady_of_philermos:0 "Honor Our Lady of Philermos"
MLTWD_honor_our_lady_of_philermos_desc:0 "Our Lady of Philermos is one of many titles given to Our Lady, the Blessed Mother of Christ, the Virgin Mary. Taken from a Byzantine icon originating in Crete, the Order has long held the Icon as its patroness. While the history of the Icon itself is long and storied, it eventually ended up in the hands of the Russian Tsars. Following the various Russian revolutions, the Icon, along with a relic of the True Cross and the hand of St. John the Baptist was returned by the Kerensky government to the Knights of Malta, as an act of goodwill between our two nations. While the Icon and other relics have remained venerated and protected since their return, a new sense of reverence has fallen over the Order regarding these relics. With the Order reconnecting to its Crusader roots, the Knights have begun to honor their patroness with a new found vigor. To encourage this, the Grandmaster has ordered that replicas of the ancient Icon are to be hung in every church that falls under the Knights' protection. By this act, we can honor Our Lady, and perhaps in return, she will honor us before her son."

MLTWD_make_blessed_gerard_proud:0 "Make Blessed Gerard Proud"
MLTWD_make_blessed_gerard_proud_desc:0 "Blessed Gerard, by all accounts, was a holy man. A lay member of the Order of St. Benedict, Bl. Gerard founded the Order of St. John as the various hospitals under his care around the Holy Land grew too large for a single Abbey to manage them all. From these humble origins, the Order would grow, eventually being militarized by our second Grandmaster, Raymond du Puy. Even though it has been almost a thousand years, and though the Order has many more functions than simply running hospitals, we have never forgotten our origins, nor our founder. Thus, in a way to honor our saintly founder and fulfill his mission while also preparing to reclaim Jerusalem, the Grandmaster has authorized the creation of an extensive welfare system throughout our held lands. Be it providing medical care free of charge or providing food or shelter to the hungry and homeless, the Order of St. John shall provide these services. If these acts also happen to win us new fighters for the Order, then everyone wins."

MLTWD_tuitio_fide:0 "Tuitio Fide"
MLTWD_tuitio_fide_desc:0 "Tuitio Fide or Defense of the Faith, is the second part of the motto of the Order of St. John. While we still care for our people and strive to build up their welfare, defending the Faith must become the most vital aspect of our Knightly Order. With us declaring that only the Knights Hospitaller are worthy of the Crusade for Jerusalem, many Catholics have begun flocking to our shores, desperate to win glory for themselves. However, many of these so-called Catholics, hold dangerous heresies in their hearts. To ensure that the reclaimed Holy Land does not fall to internal corruption, heresy shall be rooted out of the Order, and even Malta itself. Only then, when a truly Catholic Order stands, can a truly Catholic Holy Land rise."

MLTWD_deus_vult_desc:0 "All preparations are nearing completion, and the time is fast approaching for us to march against the Turks. The churches are packed to the brim, crime due to poverty is at an all time low, and the Knights never had more recruits. Soon now, very soon, the order will come down from the Grandmaster, and the Knights Hospitaller shall mobilize and strike for the Holy Land. While it will no doubt be a long and bloody conflict, God wills our progress, and with God on our side, who can stand against us?"
