Guards' commander again turned to Manshtein:\nThe soldiers are tired, and there is no end in sight. What if we stop this chatter?\nManshtein thought a bit and waved his hand:\n- Stop it, and tomorrow we'll figure it out!\nGuards' commander entered the hall through the left side entrance, slowly went up to the presidium, walked around the table behind and touched Milyukov on the shoulder. Loudly, to the whole room, in an unobjectionable tone he said:\n- The guard is tired. I ask you to stop the meeting and go home.\nMilyukov muttered something in confusion. The deputies began to make their way to the exit. Nobody even asked if there would be a next meeting."
