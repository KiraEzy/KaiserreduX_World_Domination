POR_totalist_party_long:0 "Partido Comunista Português (Rates)               §gFollowing his expulsion in 1926, following a refusal to collaborate with the Syndicalist-dominated CGT, former General Secretary José Carlos Rates has created his own splinter organisation still standing firm on an opposition of anarchist collaboration. Still holding influence over an older contingent of Communists, Rates has grown inspired by the revisionist, nationalistic Totalist school of thought during his time in France. If he were to take back control of the Party, Rates would likely take his revenge against the ascendant left-wing that ousted him and implement a technocratic, socialist system to safeguard the revolution from within and without.§!"

POR_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Comité de Unidade de Frente Única                    §gFormed with José de Sousa's alliance between the Communists and Trade Unions, the United Front Committee of Unions currently exists as a grouping of socialists, imprisoned and exiled in Paris following the failed 1930 General Strike. The General Confederation of Labour and the Portuguse Anarchist Federation are two interlinked factions, making up the Syndicalist bulwark of the United Front. The CGT is nominally led by founder Manuel Joaquim de Sousa from prison, who is represented by José da Silva Santos Arranha in Paris. The CGT is considered to be the most militant revolutionary group within Portugal, and has subsequently faced the most repression from Lisbon. The Portuguse Anarchist Federation is a wing of the Iberian Anarchist Federation, forming another political front for the CGT. Though de Sousa is a supporter of Pan-Iberian Unity, many within the CGT are at best sceptical, or at worst outwardly hostile to this position.§!"

The Portuguse Communist Party has struggled since the Restoration. Under the leadership of Bento António Gonçalves, they've operated on a policy of cooperation with the Anarchists and Syndicalists, a departure from the hostitly towards them under José Carlos Rates. By following a line of pragmatism towards the revolution, the Communists hope that the United Front strategy will bare fruit in time. The Federação Socialista das Associações de Trabalhadores (Socialist Federation of Workers' Associations) represents the moderate socialist trade unionists under the United Front, who maintain a presense within Portugal due to the lack of radical actions undertaken by them. Their small size has relegated them to an intermediary role between the CGT and the PCP.§!"

POR_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Partido Republicano da Esquerda Democrática     §gThe Democratic Leftwing Republican Party is a marxist, democratic-socialist party that formed in 1924, having split from Democratic Party following an ideological dispute with Afonso Costa. Leader José Domingues dos Santos has built the PRED around 'Moderação', an attempt to find a third way between the revolutionary syndicalism espoused by the Third Internationale, and the progressive liberalism of the Democrats. The failure of the 1930 General Strike has seen the PRED gain a small amount of steam among more radical minded exiles, though the CUFU still regards them with intense suspicion.§!"

POR_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Partido Republicano Português                              §gThe Democratic Party, offically called the Portuguese Republican Party, is a centre-left, progressive party which is the self-proclaimed successor to the original Republican Party which led the 1910 republican revolution. Formed in Feburary 1912 by Afonso Costa after the old Republican Party splintered, the Democrats were the politically dominant movement (with somewhat authoritarian tendancies) for much of the Republic's existence, until Sidonio Pais cemented his power in 1917 after which they acted as the main opposition to the conservative military dictatorship. After the restoration of the monarchy, Costa led his followers into exile and the party can be tied to almost every insurrectionist attempt to overthrow the monarchy since. Following Costa's retirement in 1931, the Democrats have been locked in a factional struggle between the populist lieutenant-colonel Liberato Pinto, who wants to reform the big-tent Democratic Party of old, and Costa's former deputy António Maria da Silva, a detail-orentated politician focused on consolidating the parties current ideology.§!"

The Nationalists were created to provide a stronger base to stand against the restored Monarchy, uniting the right-wing republicans under one banner. Their views are mixed, representing a wide range of interests and ideals, with their main unifying ideology being one of ‘Anti-Democrático’, or strong opposition to the Democratic Party.

POR_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Partido do Centro Católico                                    §gThe Catholic Centre Party formed in January 1915, with the intial goal of representing Catholic interests in the anti-clerical Republic. Not explicitly monarchist at first, that anti-clericalism naturally drew the Catholics into opposition. When the Republic began to collapse, the Catholic Centre withdrew their support, with some key members turning to royalist militancy themselves. Following the Restoration, the Catholic Centre was the largest formal political party in the Royal Congress. Amid the disastrous year of 1925, the 'Centrists' reconciled with the Integralists following Hipólito Raposo's more pragmatic stance on political cooperation. Backing the coup in 1926, the Catholics now dominate the Chamber of Peers and have come to support a German-style semi-constitutional monarchy. Since a factional dispute in 1920, ardent monarchist and integralist sympathiser José Fernando de Sousa has led the party, though his advancing age has led a younger caucus of members around Professor António Salazar to gain prominence.§!"

When the then-political party was banned following the March 17th Coup, the members of the Cause were politically isolated from King Manuel II and forced to be mere spectators of the Organic Experiment. With the coronation of Duarte II however, the royalist coalition would have a new opportunity to reassert themselves within Portugal. Though the Monarchist Cause's official purpose is the continued protection and strengthening of monarchist institutions, their secretive aim is a 'National Restoration' to empower the Monarch and form a conservative personalist dictatorship around them, whilst culling the various excesses of the ultra-radical Integralist regime. The Council's principle leaders are Marshal Couceiro and Domingos Fezas Vital, Lieutenant of the King.§!"

The group quickly became known as a counter-culture movement to the Republic, espousing an highly reactionary, traditionalist and elitist outlook on politics. Extremely anti-liberal and ultra-monarchist, the Integralists fought against the Democrats and the Republican system, though Integralist politicians cooperated with the Sidonist 'New Republic' dictatorship. As the restoration began, the Integralists were one of the most influential factions of the counter-revolutionaries. However, after the restoration, the Integralist's stagnated; viewed as dangerous by Couceiro, they were politically sidelined. Antonio Sardinha's sudden death threatened to collapse the organisation, but Hipólito Raposo rationalised the groups erosteric, often contradictory ideology and reconciled with other political groups, chiefly the Catholic Centre. After the disastrious year of 1925, the Integralists were able to lead a largely bloodless coup against the Causa Monárquica and swiftly consolidate power. Ever since, Raposo has put the Integralist's more radical ambitions on hold, which has led to discontent within the Central Junta.§!"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_DUARTE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "As agreed in the Pact of Dover signed by royalists in exile before the Restoration, Duarte II inherited the throne from the heirless Manuel II. Since he was crowned in 1932, King Duarte has looked to strengthen ties with the Brazilian Imperial Family and with the British in exile in Canada, while at home keeping an amenable relationship with the Integralists, who fully control his government; a situation he will seek to change if possible."
POLITICS_MARIA_ADLEAIDE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "Having taken up the crown after the second Regicide in 30 years, Maria III has dauting tasks ahead of her. The young Queen has always been popular when she was a princess, always looking to help people in need whenever possible. Her gentle and good demeanour may make her aggressive anti Integralist position seem surprising, but since taking the throne she has denounced excesses from that party, and her fearless attitude only helps her popularity."
POLITICS_MARIA_PUPPET_DESC:0 "As the recently installed Queen of Portugal and the Algarves, Maria Ana I seems content in her role of doing little actual ruling. Her priority is ensuring the preservation of the Monarchy and in restoring ties with the deposed royal family. Her husband's German nationality, once a liability that essentially locked her out of inheritance, may very well help in this endeavour."

por.4.t:0 "The Kingdom of Portugal"
por.4.d:0 "After the disaster in the Weltkrieg, and the collapse of our forces in Mozambique and France, Portugal's usurper republic simply lacked the face and the military support to resist the Glorious Restoration, which brought Manuel II back to the throne, and his once rival claimant Duarte Nuno as his heir. The restoration, which occurred shortly after the war's end, saw the beginning of recovery for the economy. However, reliance on British imports and exports was too great for Portugal to properly weather the storm of 1925. We were unable to even unite our lands after the fall of the British Empire, for Germany, in an act of aggression, seized those lands. With such an extensive political crisis on his hands, the then Prime Minister Paiva Couçeiro called for elections; the victorious Integralists have an extensive reform agenda, while viciously anti-republican policies have polarised opinions even amongst the most staunch monarchists. However, they defer to the King for now, and they claim that they will so indefinitely. Spain's sickness seems to never end, as more chaos looms in the world and threatens Portugal. In Africa, Hermann von Göring and his Hunnic goons sabotage our endeavours, forcing our hand to return the favour, and tensions are fast escalating. But no matter what may come, we trust that Portugal will stand tall."
por.4.a:0 "Avante!"

por.300.t:0 "The Colonial Exposition of 1936"
por.300.d:0 "Thousands have gathered for Portugal's first large scale Colonial Exposition. While the Kingdom's restoration, and other trials and tribulations it has been forced to endure, have challenged it, Portugal did not shy away from its civilising burden and redoubled its efforts to improve the Ultramarine Provinces, which are as essential as Porto or Lisbon. Many wonders and trinkets from all over the world have been brought to Lisbon for the occasion, including an entire Angolan village as an anthropological curiosity. While the endeavour was expensive, it reinforces our commitment to the Colonial Cause."
por.300.a:0 "Grand!"

por.301.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Portugal"
por.301.d:0 "While economic ties between us and Germany have never been as large or interconnected as with other European nations, the cascade effect of the Black Monday Crisis has hit Portugal with great force. With an economy mostly based on agricultural exports, and most industries focused on the rearmament plan, our usual consumers cannot afford our products and, thus, Portugal's economic situation is, yet again, in dire straits. Let us hope that we've learnt much from the lessons of the '26 Crisis and that we can, hopefully, recover much quicker this time."

However, his youngest sister, Maria Adelaide, was almost unanimously agreed as the best fit for the next Queen of Portugal by both the upper and lower houses for, despite her young age, she always was the Princess of the people. Long may Maria III reign, hopefully under peace and stability."

por.304.t:0 "Regicide!"
por.304.d:0 "As Duarte II was returning from a routine trip to the Chamber of Most Worthy Peers, his convoy was assailed by four men, clad in black and well armed. The machine gun fire did not gravely wound the Queen, Maria Francisca of Orléans-Braganza, luckily enough, but innocent subjects of the Crown were gravely injured. The wounds of the 1908 terrorist attack were re-opened, and many in the Realm demand justice. While two of the 'soldiers' of the Legião Vermelha were shot down during the ensuing firefight, two terrorists spotted on camera, Mário Castelhano and Emídio Santana, who are apart of the well known Anarchist brigands, have fled, presumably to seek refuge in the Spanish regime of the CNT-FAI. Given the gravity of the crime committed, all options are on the table, including a harsh ultimatum. Careful analysis of diplomatic consequences would be advisable, but these two murderers will be brought to justice!"

Two men, Mário Castelhano and Emídio Santana, have crossed into our borders while on the run from Portuguese authorities. Despite the successful assassination, public reception has not been unanimous and many bystanders were wounded during the operation. However, the men were armed here and, by all accounts, even without the approval of the FAI, accepting the Portuguese demand of deportation could be seen by the world as an admission of guilt; not to mention the men are likely to face execution if we hand them over. Also it is important to remember the weight of this decision on a global level. Starting a war against Portugal and their reactionary allies while we are in a weakened state and so recently after the Civil War may prove unwise, even with our allies behind us. A choice must be made, regardless; Will we hand over the duo as demanded, or prepare for the Reactionary Retaliation?"

por.306.a:0 "We have no choice but to thank them for their help..."

por.307.t:0 "The CNT-FAI Refuses Our Ultimatum"
por.307.d:0 "The treacherous dogs in Spain have granted asylum to the duo of criminals responsible for murdering our Most Faithful Majesty. Now every man must do his duty, for the final struggle against Syndicalism will soon begin!"
por.307.a:0 "As Armas!"
por.307.b:0 "We must back down, whatever the cost."

por.307001.t:0 "Portugal Backs Down"
por.307001.d:0 "After all that, the Portuguese cowards have backed down from their ultimatum. This truly shows just how spinless they are."
por.307001.a:0 "Coward and Capitalist both start with C."

por.308.t:0 "Occupy Galicia?"
por.308.d:0 "The region of Galicia, Portuguese speaking in all but in name, and long under Spain's yoke, is under the very real threat of falling under the Syndicalist menace. While some Integralists argue for an intervention to protect our brothers, many politicians have openly expressed their concern at allowing Santiago de Compostela and the relics there to be looted by Anarchist bandits. Doing that could potentially weaken the Carlists even more, however, and will ruin any chance of good relations with them if they ever manage to turn this conflict around."
por.308.a:0 "We must secure Galicia from the failing Carlists!"
por.308.b:0 "By doing this, we would be helping the Syndicalist Hydra."

por.309.t:0 "Portugal Seizes Galicia!"
por.309.d:0 "The slithering snakes in Portugal have occupied Galicia while our forces struggle against the godless forces of the CNT-FAI. While they claim it's to ensure their Galician 'brothers' are safe from the yoke of Syndicalism, it's abundantly clear that this land grab is little more than blatant opportunism!"
por.309.a:0 "We will correct this later..."

por.310.t:0 "Seize Olivença?"
por.310.d:0 "Olivença has been illegally under Spanish control since a mishap in the 1801 Treaty of Badajoz. With Spain in civil war, they are not in a position to contest our reclaiming, for while the border dispute has great potential propaganda value for us, the town is virtually worthless strategically"
por.310.a:0 "Let's liberate the town from the Spanish Yoke!"
por.310.b:0 "If it's so worthless, why betray a fellow Monarch while he struggles against atheists and traitors?"

por.311.t:0 "Portugal Seizes Olivença!"
por.311.d:0 "Portugal has occupied the small town of Olivenza, claiming it is long lost Portuguese land, and we are not in a position to react as of now. If we wish to recover it, it will have to happen at some later point!"
por.311.a:0 "Jackals! Vultures!"

por.312.t:0 "The Matters of the Realm"
por.312.d:0 "Much turmoil has befallen our Realm during this disastrous century. However, our nation endures and is stronger than ever. Now, the time has come to reform our government and wash away the last remnants of the corrupt republic, to help secure a better future."
por.312.a:0 "The future beckons!"

por.313.t:0 "For King and Country"
por.313.d:0 "The Integralists and other manipulative demagogues have, for far too long, interfered in the nation's well being. The King, his advisers, and parliament should be making the decisions about Portugal's future; not pampered intellectuals living in Lisbon or hiding in Paris. We will shape the Monarchy into something truly grand!"
por.313.a:0 "Vida Longa ao Rei!"

por.314.t:0 "The Burden We Bear"
por.314.d:0 "We must rise above our petty differences and unite under our Faith, our Country, and our People. And most importantly, we must bring the light of civilisation to the poor and unfortunate souls who need Christ in their lives. It is neither an expensive nor glorious endeavour to build outposts in the dark of the jungle and spread civilisation, but, nonetheless, it is our ultimate goal. And, of course, so is defending our faith against those who seek to destroy it!"
por.314.a:0 "Forward towards a better Portugal and a better World."

por.315.t:0 "Portugal Formally Rejoins the Entente"
por.315.d:0 "After the end of the Weltkrieg with the signing of the Peace with Honour, and even more so after the Revolution in '25, Britain and Portugal have drifted further and further apart despite being in a formal alliance. But now, as dangerous times begin to threaten us, would it be wise to turn to our oldest friend for aid?"
por.315.a:0 "We will renew the world's oldest and greatest alliance, and beat back the Syndicalist Hydra."
por.315.b:0 "We'll refrain for now."

por.316.t:0 "Portugal Asks Us To Rejoin the Entente Formally"
por.316.d:0 "After the end of the Weltkrieg with the signing of the Peace with Honour, and even more so after the Revolution in '25, Britain and Portugal have drifted further and further apart despite remaining in a formal alliance. But now, as dangerous times begin to threaten Europe, and the time to reclaim the birthright is fast approaching, Portugal asks us for support and will, in turn, provide support during the fast-approaching War."
por.316.a:0 "With the renewal of this treaty, we will stop Syndicalism!"

por.321.t:0 "Update on Mittelafrika: Police Officer Shot"
por.321.d:0 "Today we learnt that a Makonde tribesman has shot a Mittelafrikan police officer in Lusaka. The city is still in shock and the perpetrator, along with his supporters, have been detained for investigation by the local police. It appears we are already managing to destabilise the Mittelafrikan government. It should be noted that he used a weapon supplied by us, but we are confident it won't get traced back to us."
por.321.a:0 "Of course it won't be."

por.322.t:0 "Update on Mittelafrika: Military Depot Raided"
por.322.d:0 "Another update; earlier today some 'bandits' raided and stole supplies from a Mittelafrikan military depot and then escaped with the supplies back to their camp in Mozambique. Those 'bandits' were of course supplied and trained by us; they are getting bold and don't even fear the Mittelafrikan Askari any more! We have heard rumours that the Mittelafrikan government is having a meeting soon to decide what to do about these 'bandits' and the destabilising effect they are having."
por.322.a:0 "This might be trouble..."

por.323.t:0 "Fate of the Lusitanian Integralist Movement in the Face of the Dual Monarchy"
por.323.d:0 "With both Portugal and Brazil now falling under the God-blessed system of Lusitanian Integralism, many have suggested that our two sister crowns come together as one in a cooperative government under two equal crowns, uniting the Lusophone sphere under a dual monarchy headed by the royal houses of our two equal nations for the good of all true Christians in our sphere. Though this would likely be a logistical nightmare to pull off, the peaceful unification of Brazil and Portugal is well within our reach, if we simply reach for it. Alternatively, we could pursue a more truncated form of this dream, keeping separate states but united by a singular purpose, or we could just abandon the insane plan all together. What shall be the fate of imperialist and Integralist Lusophonic unity?"
por.323.a:0 "Ignore this pretender throne!"
por.323.b:0 "Work hand in hand with our brethren."
por.323.c:0 "Subjugate their regime and grant them fleeting autonomy."
por.323.e:0 "Unite the two governments under a dual throne!"

por.325.t:0 "The Fate of our Familial Ties"
por.325.d:0 "Although we have come to embrace God’s honest truth within this noble Integralist system, our brethren across the Atlantic have lost the plot as they drift towards false ideologies and godless heathenry in their pursuit of non-Integralist politics. Should we set sail across the sea in order to reunite Brazil and Portugal at long last under a single Integralist crown, or should we leave our old kin to rot while we chase our own destiny?"
por.325.a:0 "Set sail for our lost brethren to unite the Lusophonic world with Integralism!"
por.325.b:0 "Leave our kin to rot."

por.400.t:0 "Supremacy in West Africa"
por.400.d:0 "With Portuguese control of French Guinea and Sierra Leone, and any French recapture attempt likely to incur massive casualties, it is clear the French are on the backfoot. It may be wise to inform the French that if they ever intend to return home they should admit defeat, else get bogged down in a colonial war over some not very vital lands."
por.400.a:0 "Send the French our terms"
por.400.b:0 "Peace? We will march on Algiers!"

por.401.t:0 "Defeat in West Africa"
por.401.d:0 "With Portuguese control of French Guinea and Sierra Leone, it is clear the military situation has developed in a manner not in our favour. Any recapture attempt likely to incur massive casualties, and we cannot afford to lose the proud Frenchmen that will be needed for the reclamation. Do we accept their terms?"
por.401.a:0 "Save our bullets for the Communards"
por.401.b:0 "Crush these upstarts!"

por.402.t:0 "French defiance!"
por.402.d:0 "The heat seems to have got to the heads of the French, and they have outright rejected our merciful terms! It is clear peace was never an option. We must march on Algiers and make French North Africa Portuguese North Africa!"
por.402.a:0 "To Algiers it is. Avante!"

por.405.t:0 "Control of the Buffer"
por.405.d:0 "Our armies have managed to reach the extent of the planned buffer. While we could go further, the strain on our armies to fight the war and on the state to administer the region would be great. If we send an agreement to the Princes demanding the buffer in exchange for peace and Portuguese withdrawl from lands beyond the buffer, they will likely accept. What will it be?"
por.405.a:0 "Send the Princes our terms"
por.405.b:0 "Portuguese South India sounds good"

por.406.t:0 "The Portuguese March from Goa!"
por.406.d:0 "A surprise invasion of the Portuguese from Goa has left a sizable area of territory in their hands, which they now demand as a buffer in exchange for peace. Do we accept their terms?"
por.406.a:0 "We'll deal with them later"
por.406.b:0 "No surrender!"

por.407.t:0 "Indian Refusal!"
por.407.d:0 "The Princely Federation has refused our just terms!"
por.407.a:0 "They will pay for their foolishness"


por.410.t:0 "Control of the Ivory Coast"
por.410.d:0 "Once again, we have humiliated Mittelafrika, and once again we are in a position to demand concessions. We could make demands, which they are likely going to have to accept, to take the Ivory Coast in exchange for a withdrawl from the Gold Coast and any other disputed areas which we control. Or, seeing as these humiliations seem to be regular for them, we could but this juggernaught out of its misery, although the Germans are unlikely to accept us doing so."
por.410.a:0 "Inform Mittelafrika of our Terms"
por.410.b:0 "Slay the Germanic beast!"

por.411.t:0 "Defeat in West Africa"
por.411.d:0 "With Portuguese control of the Ivory Coast, it is clear the military situation has developed in a manner not in our favour. Any recapture attempt likely to incur massive casualties, and we cannot afford to lose proud Germans that will be needed for preserving Mittelafrika. Do we accept their terms?"
por.411.a:0 "Save our bullets for the Natives"
por.411.b:0 "Crush these upstarts!"

por.412.t:0 "German refusal!"
por.412.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, madness seems to have set in among the Germans of Mittelafrika. They have steadfastly refused our terms, announcing total war against the Portuguese Empire, ensuring Berlin there will be no humiliation this year. It seems that we are in Africa for the long haul."
por.412.a:0 "We will hang Goering in Dar-es-Salaam!"

por.415.t:0 "We have Galicia!"
por.415.d:0 "Our armies have raced into Galicia, and the region is now under our control. We can demand the Spanish recognise our annexation of the region in exchange for peace, demands they are likely to accept with the numerous other issues their country faces other then a Portuguese invasion. Or, we can venture futher, and neutralise the Spanish threat for good, although public support for the war wanes with no clear aim for the remainder of the war."

por.535.d:0 "With our full occupation of Morocco, it is quickly becoming clear the region is a naval blindspot for the Germans, out of reach of both Mittelafrika and the German Empire proper. We can sue for a 'Peace with Honour', where the Germans can sweep this war under the rug and pass it off as a Portuguese invasion of nominally independent Morocco, and instead lodge a minor diplomatic protest at our 'violation of Moroccan sovereignty. This will likely make peace far more likely. Do we issue such a demand or fight on?"

POR_core_angola:0 "Incorporate Angola into Portugal"
POR_core_angola_desc:0 "Portuguese boots have stood proudly in Angola since 1575. It is high time we recognise this region is as Portuguese as any European or Atlantic possession. Angola é Nossa!"
POR_core_mos:0 "Incorporate Mozambique into Portugal"
POR_core_mos_desc:0 "As Europeanisation in Mozambique marches forward, it is time this region joins its Portuguese brothers and is integrated into the realm, no longer a mere far-flung colony in South East Africa."
POR_core_goa:0 "Incorporate Goa into Portugal"
POR_core_goa_desc:0 "After over 400 years of Portuguese rule, only interupted by the British during the Napoleonic Wars, it is time the years of trade, in-migration and relgious conversions paid off. Portuguese India is Portugal."
POR_core_macau:0 "Incorporate Macau into Portugal"
POR_core_macau_desc:0 "Since 1557 we have held dominion in Macao. It is one of our oldest territories, and while not very European, the compliant population of Macao will be pleased to become Portuguese, free of the strife to their north."
POR_core_timor:0 "Incorporate East Timor into Portugal"
POR_core_timor_desc:0 "We arrived in Timor in 1515 and it has been a colony since 1702. Neglected by the Republic as an exploitable trading post, this has changed under the Integralists. While remaining mostly illiterate and culturally non-European, the church-educated Portuguese Timorese elite will lead, and the rest follow."
POR_core_guinea:0 "Incorporate Guinea into Portugal"
POR_core_guinea_desc:0 "While suffering particularly from the slump after the British Revolution, and being a centre of revolutionary sentiment, Guinea in recent years has fared well under Portugal, benefitting from its proximity to Cape Verde and the Homeland. It now stands as a compliant region, and will be rewarded with integration."

POR_iberia_cat:0 "Iberian Matters" 
POR_iberia_cat_desc:0 "To our east stands Spain, in constant civil strife as has been the case since the days of Napoleon. What happens in regard to Spain is vital to our sovereignty. Matters with Spain must be settled before they recover and attempt to dominate us once more, this time potentially under a red banner!"
POR_GAL:0 "Reunite with our Northern Brothers"
POR_GAL_desc:0 "Too our north stands Galicia, a region lingustically and culturally similar to us, yet has been dominated and brutalised by the Spanish for hundreds of years. We must assert our control over this region and free what should be a Portuguese province from the Spanish yoke!"
POR_GBR:0 "Take Gibraltar"
POR_GBR_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the British Revolution, the Spanish marched into Gibraltar, asserting their dominance of the straight along with the Rif. This threatens our access to the Mediterranean, which threatens our access to the Suez, which threatens our provinces in India and the Far East! We cannot allow this threat to continue any longer, and we can be assured the Anglo population of Gibraltar and the Morrocans of the Rif will be pleased to be free of the Spanish."
POR_KSP:0 "End Spain"
POR_KSP_desc:0 "With our seizure of both Gibraltar and Galicia, the Spanish are clearly still weak and faultering. If they are allowed to recover, they will surely sweep west, seeking to reclaim the lands we have taken from them. This cannot be allowed to happen. Spain must be destroyed."
POR_restore_order_galicia:0 "Restore Order in Galicia"
POR_restore_order_galicia_desc:0 "Many in Galicia foolishly remain loyal to Spain, while others favour an independent republic. These two groups must be crushed, the loyal population rewarded, and the region administratively integrated into the growing Portuguese realm."
POR_restore_order_gibraltar:0 "Restore Order in Gibraltar"
POR_restore_order_gibraltar_desc:0 "The Anglos of Gibraltar have changed hands numerous times in the last 20 years, and now they fall to us. While they aren't exactly pleased that non-British sovereignty over the territory continues, we may be able to amend this by doing what the Spanish refused to do; Handing local rule to local Anglos, and giving these Anglos a pathway into the Portuguese Imperial bureaucracy. Its a win-win situation, and endearing the Anglos to us will allow us to integrate the small population into our realm successfully."

POR_SA_cat:0 "Returning to South America"
POR_SA_cat_desc:0 "The vast state of Brazil is overwhelmingly Portuguese speaking, and many there are of Portuguese heritage. This land was never meant to slip from our grasp, and should've remained as much a part of Portugal as any European territory. No matter, we shall right this wrong."
POR_BRA:0 "Reconquer Brazil!"
POR_BRA_desc:0 "It is time to return our rightful South American lands. The human and natural resources of Brazil are just what we need to get our new Empire off the ground. Avante!"
POR_URG:0 "Finish the conflict over Uruguay"
POR_URG_desc:0 "Uruguay has been a battleground between Portuguese and Spanish peoples throughout its history, first between the Spanish and us, then among the Brazilians and Argentines. Unfortunately, in the long term the Spaniards won out, and Portuguese is a minority language confined to northern border regions. This must be corrected for."

POR_SEA_cat:0 "Securing Global Sea Lanes"
POR_SEA_cat_desc:0 "While controlling vast swathes of land is important, it is useless if we can be cut off from them at any moment by a foreign power. We must take the vital straits to ensure that our beautiful homeland is never cut off from parts of Portugal further from the centre."
POR_SUEZ:0 "Seize the Suez" 
POR_SUEZ_desc:0 "When Benjamin Disraeli purchased the Suez Canal Company and sold it to the British government to prevent the French getting their hands on it, our access to the East was secured. However, with the British Revolution and the Cairo Pact-Ottoman confrontation, there has been turmoil at the Suez to say the least. We must perform the service the British did before, and provide safe, uninterupted passage to the east."
POR_PANAMA:0 "Capture the Panama Canal"
POR_PANAMA_desc:0 "With the Second American Civil War throwing the future of the Panama Canal into turmoil, the question of the route to the pacific and of our naval control of the Americas has arisen. The Canal must be wrestled into Portuguese hands."
POR_SING:0 "The Singapore Strategy"
POR_SING_desc:0 "Another stait that in better times the British would have kept open to Portuguese ships. No longer. Now, we must take control of this city with the blood of Portuguese patriots, and if all succeeds, we should consider seizing Eastern Sumatra for full dominance of the Strait of Malacca."
POR_BAB:0 "Control the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait"
POR_BAB_desc:0 "While not as well known as presigious as the Suez, the Bab-el-Mandeb is just as much of a threat to shipping in the East. Now we have the Suez, we must consolidate our hold on the Red Sea."
POR_CON:0 "Capture the Bosphorus"
POR_CON_desc:0 "While access to the Black Sea is not important to us, it may be important to our enemies. Returning Constantinople to Christendom too makes the endeavor worthwhile."

POR_empire_cat:0 "Expansion of the Portuguese Empire"
POR_empire_cat_desc:0 "We will not rest until we have taken the title of global hegemon and formed an empire across the globe which cannot be challenged in size or might! Many laugh at such a notion, lets make sure that we have the last laugh."
POR_MOR:0 "End Morroco"
POR_MOR_desc:0 "While the Reconquista ended with the Muslims pushed out of Iberia, it can be argued that it didn't go far enough. For years the Mohammadeans have stood tall across the straight of Gibraltar, taunting us. This is an insult to Christendom that we shall stand for no longer!"
POR_NFA:0 "Expand Portuguese Guinea"
POR_NFA_desc:0 "While the French Republic was our ally in the Weltkrieg, they have fallen on hard times. They stand throughout North Africa and West Africa in the blazing sun, extracting what they can from the natives by force under the delusion they can return home. Lets seize their South-Western lands to help them realise the depths of their situation."
POR_LIB:0 "Expand Portuguese West Africa into Liberia"
POR_LIB_desc:0 "Liberia is said to be one of the last "free" African nations. In reality it is ruled by a tiny minority of Americo-Liberians. This minority has formed an aristocracy distinct from the native 98%, differentiating themselves in speech, dress, source and level of income, style of life and culture. Large land purchases were made by the Americo-Liberians from chiefs to whom permanent alienation of land was an unfamiliar concept. They pretend to be a little USA, so let us free the natives as a stepping stone to destroying the real USA."
POR_WAF:0 "Expand Portuguese West Africa into the Ivory Coast"
POR_WAF_desc:0 "The Portuguese West Africa project has only one piece remaining from completion. Let us march east and finish the creation of what shall become a model colony!"
POR_MAF:0 "Expand into Mittelafrika"
POR_MAF_desc:0 "It was not long ago when we seemingly neutralised the threat of Mittelafrika. Many international observers believed such a humiliation might bring down the hulking inefficent juggernaut. This has not come to pass, and now Mittelafrika continues to sit to our north and south, licking its wounds, planning to sieze our African holdings for good! We can no longer tolerate such a threat. Mittelafrika is an anti-civilisational abomination that must be cleansed from existance. We shall take border regions that make Mittelafrika unable to touch the Ultramarine Provinces, or properly function for that matter."
POR_RHO:0 "Rhodesian Reunification"
POR_RHO_desc:0 "With our hold on North Rhodesia secured, we turn south, where our Anglo friends now form a sizable minority of the population. South Rhodesia has been well managed by these settlers, with a balanced budget and increasing wages among settlers and natives. We should protect these Anglos from the vicious Boers to their South, or any potential native threat that they may struggle against. The region should prove economically valuable to us, and the Anglo adminstrators may prove useful in the management of our holdings which continue to increase in number and strain the state."
POR_IND:0 "A Buffer for Goa"
POR_IND_desc:0 "Our proud province of Goa stands as an example of Portuguese civilisation among a sea of conflict and strife that is the Indian subcontinent. However, not all is well, as the constant threat of the siezure of Goa hangs over the provice like the Sword of Damocles. We do not yet seek to rule all of India, however a sparsely populated region that would take little administrative toll on our nation lies to the East of Goa, a suitable buffer for our grand province. It may too prove useful in the future if we decide to expand our ambitions. We must take this region at all costs. Into India!"
POR_DEI:0 "Riches of the East Indies"
POR_DEI_desc:0 "Our small territory of East Timor stands surrounded by the Indonesian territories, with the island of Timor itself in need of full unification. We shall sieze West Timor and take other strategically important and resource rich islands."
POR_GEA:0 "Strike the Germanic presence in the Far East!"
POR_GEA_desc:0 "Mittelafrika and German East Asia. Two talons of the Germanic Eagle, the former based on dominance of large swathes of land, the latter based on dominance of the seas. We shall break the thalassocracy, and annex the territories of it into our growing empire!"
POR_CEY:0 "Reclaim Ceylon!"
POR_CEY_desc:0 "We lost Ceylon after years of rule in 1658. After falling to the Dutch, then the British, and then the Germans, rule of the island has circulated among many European powers after falling from our grasp. Evidence of the Portuguese civilising mission still exists to this day, and it is time we resume it."

POR_OIL_cat:0 "Black Gold for Portugal"
POR_OIL_cat_desc:0 "With oil supplies increasingly important, we must make sure that our fleet and forces have the fuel to feed them. Venezuela, the Ottoman Turks, Iran. 3 targets that invading will ensure we dominate the global oil supply."
POR_TUR:0 "Iraq War"
POR_TUR_desc:0 "While we have claimed to the international community that chemical weapons are being used in Iraq and we are protecting the peoples of Mesopotamia, in reality we seek to take the resources that the region contains. It is for the greater good of allowing our fair hand to spread further across the globe."
POR_IRA:0 "War for the Persian Gulf"
POR_IRA_desc:0 "The region of Khuzestan is an Arabic speaking, and more imporantly, oil-rich region of Persia. It will be a perfect addition to our Iraqi holdings."
POR_VEN:0 "Venezuelan Oil"

POR_china_cat:0 "Subjugation of China"
POR_china_cat_desc:0 "While the British Raj ruled over a subcontinent, there is a civilisation to the North of it that while facing European domination, never fell under European rule. China. We shall move from Macau into Guangdong, establish our own government for China, then go on our own Northern Expedition until all China is under the Portuguese banner! Many in the King's Cabinet call this plan madness, a waste of Portuguese lives. Let us show them, there is no madness when we know God is on our side!"

POR_rivals_cat_desc:0 "While our Imperial Ambitions seem selfish on the surface, they all serve a greater good. Since the French Revolution, accelerated by the Weltkrieg, a number of evils have taken root. The Evil of Liberalism, a leveling, equalising, egalitarian force that seeks to create a society of mass man - of interchangable people undifferentiated from eachother, no longer united under God, but united in consumption, no matter how degenerate this consumption is. To destroy this we shall eliminate the centre of this evil - the United States of America, before they grow strong enough to dominate the world and bathe it in liberalism. Then there is the Evil of Syndicalism, another equalising force taking the equality aspect of liberalism to its logical conclusion - equality of outcome, and this anti-nature force too must be smothered in its crib. We shall free our old friends, the British, from this evil, and destroy the perfidious French and their vile commune. These evils aside, there are the powers of Japan and Germany, the former threatening God fearing Europeans in the East, the latter butching its way through the God fearing of Europe, and the globe. We shall destroy Japanese naval supremacy in the East, and gain long desired revenge against the Germanic hoarde."

We stood alone on the continent opposing the French before, we shall do it again, this time without British help! We shall save Europe from this beast! Avante!"

POR_govern:0 "Portugese Governorate"
POR_govern_desc:0 "The administration of this region is centred on little more than the diktat of a Portuguese Governor. The Governor ultimately answers to Lisbon, and the local population can do little more then dance to the whims of what they once saw as their smaller, less significant neighbour." 
POR_luso:0 "Lusotropicalism"
POR_luso_desc:0 "Based on the work of Gilberto Freyre, we have embraced the ideas of Lusotropicalism. Building on five centuries of our humane civilising mission, we have given further devolved powers to our overseas territories, encouraged mixing between Iberian-Portuguese subjects and natives abroad, and reduced levels of repression against natives. While the results have been mixed, we are generally experiencing a higher level of consent for our governance overseas."
por.150.t:0 "British Administrators Volunteer"
por.150.d:0 "The collapse of the British Empire left many cast adrift, having lost their purpose of serving the Empire. Among the settlers, soldiers, engineers and others who kept the vast empire going, were a number of highly skilled administrators. With many fleeing to South Rhodesia with the fall of British colonies to Germany, and many stranded and deciding to settle in Gibraltar, our hold on these two territories has allowed us access to their wealth of skills. With their help, we may hold together an Empire larger than the British one that came before!"

POR_anglos:0 "British Administrators"
POR_anglos_desc:0 "With consent for our governance in Gibraltar and Rhodesia increasing among the Anglo population of these territories, we have begun admitting them into our growing bureaucracy to assist in the governance of our colonial territories."
POR_sueznossa:0 "Suez Profits"
POR_sueznossa_desc:0 "With our hasty repairs and control of the Suez Canal we are reaping the economic rewards of the thousands of tonnes of global trade flowing through the canal."
por.151.t:0 "Benefits of Controlling the Suez"
por.151.d:0 "With the help of engineers both foreign and of the Empire, we have very quickly repaired the scars of war on the Suez Canal. Global traders are relieved to no longer have to go around the Cape to reach their destinations, and are very much willing to pay the tolls we charge at the canal. As a result, a huge amount of money is flooding into our treasury, with little sign of stopping. Today is a good day for the Portuguese Empire."
por.151.a:0 "To Gold!"
POR_africanossa:0 "African Hegemony"
POR_africanossa_desc:0 "With our control of vast swathes of Africa, the French Republic failing as ever, native realms rife for taking, and Mittelafrika consigned to the dustbin of history, our rule over Africa is utterly unchallenged. 500 years of work by Portuguese men is paying off, and let it continue for another 500! África é Nossa!"
por.152.t:0 "África é Nossa!"
por.152.d:0 "For days a great silence overtook the North, and we wondered if the Hun was planning to be defeated in a Third Bush War, reversing their evacuation of Mittelafrika to spite us. However, as the trickle of both African and European refugees turned into a flood, it has quickly become apparent that Mittelafrika has totally collapsed. Two major defeats and one mass evacuation had left Mittelafrika as a shadow of its former self. This shadow still looms over Africa, as the failure of the Germanic civilising mission is evident wherever their vile boots have stepped on this continent. With this collapse, we stand as the last major European power in Africa, with the French being more prisoners of Africa then a power in their own right on it. With the old German African Hegemony shattered, we can now do as we please on the continent, and reap the great rewards of doing so."
por.152.a:0 "Total Victory!"
POR_navytime:0 "Naval Ambition"
POR_navytime_desc:0 "At over 600 years old, the Portuguese Navy is the oldest continuously serving navy in the world. While things have improved in the last few years with purchases of surplus British ships at rock-bottom prices after the 1925 Revolution left Entente ports overwhelmed, our fleet is still dwarfed by our rivals and our ships outdated. By bringing in expertise from across the Empire and the World, we will change this."
