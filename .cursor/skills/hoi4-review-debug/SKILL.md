description: Diagnose, review, improve, balance, optimize, migrate, and test existing Hearts of Iron IV mods from source through an isolated in-game run. Use for whole-mod health audits, gameplay design/balance/UX review, error.log triage, Windows crash dumps/minidumps, parser or scope bugs, broken GUI/assets/localisation, AI behavior, performance, save/lifecycle risks, compatibility, version updates, template audits, regression plans, or user-approved Steam and game testing.

# HOI4 review and debug

## Choose the evidence lane

- Diagnosis: reproduce and trace one symptom before changing code.
- Fix: identify the earliest root cause, repair the smallest coherent graph,
  and rerun the reproduction.
- Existing-mod improvement: establish a whole-mod baseline, rank engineering
  and player-experience findings, obtain approval for subjective changes, then
  improve in reviewable batches using
  [improve-existing-mod.md](workflows/improve-existing-mod.md).
- Review: report concrete findings ordered by impact with file/line evidence.
- Gameplay/balance/UX: compare the implemented player loop, costs, rewards, AI,
  feedback, layout, and localisation against the documented player promise;
  use [gameplay-balance-ux-review.md](references/gameplay-balance-ux-review.md).
- Performance: determine execution frequency and scope count before optimizing.
- Lifecycle/save audit: enumerate create, update, consume, clear, reload,
  migration, and dependency paths.
- Template audit: verify target build, placeholders, schema, current consumer,
  dependency chain, and runtime status.
- Native crash diagnosis: ask for the exact pre-crash action timeline and
  governing jurisdiction, then follow the staged consent and confidence gates
  in
  [native-crash-reverse-engineering.md](references/native-crash-reverse-engineering.md).
  Never infer jurisdiction from language or broaden one authorization into
  static decompilation, tool installation, or live-process debugging.
- Runtime test: ask for consent, isolate the playset, launch with `-debug`, run
  the smallest scenario, inspect fresh logs, iterate, and restore user settings.

Read [review-workflows.md](references/review-workflows.md),
[field-tested-pitfalls.md](references/field-tested-pitfalls.md),
[native-crash-reverse-engineering.md](references/native-crash-reverse-engineering.md),
[mod-doctor.md](references/mod-doctor.md), and, for missing or broken artwork,
[icon-audit.md](references/icon-audit.md). For footprint reduction or media
conversion, follow [optimize-media.md](workflows/optimize-media.md). Also read
the sibling base skill's `performance-debugging.md`, `review-checklist.md`, and
`localisation-deep-dive.md`. For every existing-feature review, also follow
[semantic-intent-audit.md](../hoi4-pdx-modding/references/semantic-intent-audit.md)
before accepting an inferred feature meaning. Use the builder's
[test-mod.md](../hoi4-content-builder/workflows/test-mod.md) for runtime work.

## Establish evidence

Inspect target guidance, version, dependencies, playset, `git status`, changed
files, definitions, callers, and the newest relevant log. Use installed schema
and current vanilla/dependency consumers for unfamiliar tokens. Distinguish
parser errors, semantic errors, runtime behavior, and optional-media warnings.

For a crash, ask what the player did immediately before it before assigning a
cause. Record the window, tab, or control used; pause and speed state; date
advance; save/load; console and debug commands; GUI debug or hot refresh;
in-session file edits; overlays; and whether a clean restart reproduces it.

Before judging or optimizing a feature, read its names, descriptions, options,
tooltips, scripted-localisation branches, GUI labels, and character text. Map
each code ID to its visible meaning and player-facing promise. Never identify a
character or mechanic by transliterating an internal token. Treat any
code/localisation disagreement as a finding to resolve, not as permission to
ignore the localisation.

Use the read-only tools when applicable:

- `scripts/audit-hoi4-mod.ps1`: build a cross-file health baseline covering
  event and scripted-object graphs, strong localisation/GFX/resource links,
  duplicate/orphan definitions, periodic hot-path heuristics, and comment
  coverage. It can resolve the active playset, compare changed files or a prior
  baseline, apply expiring suppressions, audit media, and emit JSON, Markdown,
  or SARIF. When `-GameRoot` is supplied it also target-scans installed DLC
  interface trees and distinguishes same-basename texture extension mismatches.
  Treat `lead` findings as investigation targets, not edit authority.
- `scripts/analyze-hoi4-log.ps1`: prioritize and compare logs.
- Installed WinDbg/CDB: when a Windows crash package contains a `.dmp`, use the
  debugger read-only before judging the crash; follow the minidump workflow in
  `review-workflows.md`. Obtain explicit consent before reverse-engineering a
  native call path. If minimum analysis is not high-confidence, report the
  missing evidence and ask before verified Ghidra/JDK acquisition or deeper
  static analysis; ask again before launching or attaching to a live process.
  Do not install tools without user authorization.
- `scripts/audit-localisation.ps1`: inspect BOMs, headers, suffixes, duplicate
  keys, colour markers, nested tokens, dynamic variables, and functions.
- `scripts/audit-hoi4-map.ps1`: check map IDs/colors and history membership.
- `scripts/audit-vanilla-overrides.ps1`: inventory overrides, `replace_path`,
  hashes, and migration gates.

Fix the first parser failure in each file before cascades. For every finding,
state the triggering path, failure mechanism, user-visible effect, and smallest
remedy. Do not apply conventions from another mod or old version universally.

When reviewing generated content, search for `MOD`, sample tags, example IDs,
placeholder text, copied asset paths, unresolved localisation, and conflict
markers. Brace balance alone does not prove scopes, lifecycle, AI behavior,
history IDs, or GUI/GFX wiring.

## Verify and hand off

Follow the sibling `hoi4-pdx-modding` **Validate proportionally** lanes.
Do not run the full validator, Mod Doctor, focused audits, or a fresh-log
comparison because a small edit exists. User AI quota is not free.
Inspect-only diffs are complete after a careful read.

When scripts are warranted, run the cheapest matching check on the edited
paths. Broader audits and log comparison belong to whole-mod, rename,
GUI/map, compatibility, release, or migration work. Non-trivial static
work ends with a consent question: does the user want AI-assisted in-game
testing? Never open Steam, change launch options, alter a playset, or
start HOI4 without that consent. Do not offer a Steam prompt after
inspect-only work unless the user asked.

For every applied fix or refactor, update the canonical mod technical document,
current development handoff, and readable comments for affected contracts.
Review their accuracy alongside code and localisation before completion.

For a whole-mod improvement, fill the bundled
`assets/templates/mod-improvement-report.md` with the before/after baseline,
approved scope, evidence, deferred design choices, and remaining risks. Never
silently turn a balance preference or narrative taste into a defect.

For an approved test, use computer-use when available and follow the builder's
runtime workflow. Enable only the target mod, plus exact required dependencies
for a submod; use `-debug`; start a new game from the earliest available
bookmark; exercise the changed content; read the logs; improve and retest; then
restore any launch and playset settings changed for the test. Report confirmed
results, reasoned risks, and any interactions still requiring the user.
