name: hoi4-content-builder
description: Turn plain-language ideas into complete, playable Hearts of Iron IV mods and advanced systems. Use when a user describes a mod without knowing PDX script, or requests events, decisions, focuses, countries, characters, ideas, MIOs, doctrines, raids, special projects, AI, OOBs, factions, diplomacy, GUI, map modes, localisation, models, music, or release packaging. Includes verified templates, multi-file kits, full workflows, and runtime-test handoff.

# HOI4 content builder

## Start from the user's idea

The user may describe only the desired fantasy or gameplay result. Do not ask
them to design scopes, files, triggers, or syntax. Read
[natural-language-intake.md](references/natural-language-intake.md), infer safe
defaults, and produce a concise content contract covering visible behavior,
rules, AI, lifecycle, compatibility, assets, save impact, and acceptance tests.

Read target-repository guidance and sibling `hoi4-pdx-modding` references for
every affected system. Discover the game, mod, dependency, and playset paths;
never assume the paths or conventions from the machine that authored this
skill. Verify version-sensitive syntax in installed documentation and current
vanilla or dependency consumers.

When extending or repairing existing content, first read all affected visible
localisation and scripted-localisation consumers. Follow the sibling skill's
[semantic-intent-audit.md](../hoi4-pdx-modding/references/semantic-intent-audit.md)
before translating IDs into a content contract. Identifiers are not evidence
for character names, narrative roles, costs, dates, or player-facing behavior.
For a whole-mod health, balance, UX, or improvement pass rather than one
requested feature, route to the sibling `hoi4-review-debug` skill's
`improve-existing-mod.md` workflow.

## Choose a workflow

- New mod from an idea: [build-complete-mod.md](workflows/build-complete-mod.md)
- One feature in an existing mod: [build-feature.md](workflows/build-feature.md)
- Advanced or cross-system feature: [build-advanced-system.md](workflows/build-advanced-system.md)
- Country/state/map history: [build-map-history.md](workflows/build-map-history.md)
- Collections, arrays, event targets, dynamic modifiers, or dynamic text:
  [use-advanced-patterns.md](workflows/use-advanced-patterns.md)
- Static-to-runtime validation: [test-mod.md](workflows/test-mod.md)
- Versioned distribution: [release-mod.md](workflows/release-mod.md)

Use [system-coverage.md](references/system-coverage.md) to route any beginner or
advanced feature and [advanced-engineering.md](references/advanced-engineering.md)
for architecture, performance, compatibility, save migration, and tooling.

## Reuse verified resources

Start from `assets/templates/` for one object and `assets/kits/` for a proven
multi-file dependency chain. Read [template-catalog.md](references/template-catalog.md)
before copying. Replace every `MOD`, sample numeric ID, path, asset, and text.
Templates are not permission to skip target-build verification.

Treat `assets/template-manifest.json` as the machine-readable verification
contract. Run `scripts/validate-template-manifest.ps1` after changing templates
or kits; rebuild the manifest with `scripts/build-template-manifest.ps1 -Force`
only after updating the human catalog and verifying the new current consumer.

Use `scripts/new-country-scaffold.ps1` to generate a staged country tree and
`scripts/generate-gfx-manifest.ps1` for deterministic sprite registration.
Generate into an empty staging directory, review the diff, then merge only the
required files into the target mod. Never let a helper silently overwrite the
target tree.

If no verified resource fits, follow [verify-template.md](workflows/verify-template.md):
check installed schema, at least one current working consumer, caller scopes,
all dependent resources, and a minimal runtime test before promoting it.

## Build the complete graph

1. Establish stable IDs and file ownership.
2. Map IDs to visible names, descriptions, tooltips, and promised behavior.
3. Create definitions before consumers.
4. Wire callers, lifecycle updates, cleanup, AI, and compatibility gates.
5. Add or update localisation and visible assets for every player-facing path.
6. Search the whole target mod for definitions, callers, stale IDs, and
   collisions. Preserve unrelated work and project encoding conventions.
7. Keep a minimal runnable path first; add branches and optimization only after
   the core path validates.
8. Create or update the mod's technical documentation and current development
   handoff, and add readable contract comments to the implementation. Use the
   base skill's `development-documentation.md` and the bundled documentation
   templates; documentation is part of the feature graph.

Do not stop after writing the central object. A focus needs effects and text; a
GUI needs sprites, callbacks, and localisation; a project needs facilities,
scientists, rewards, AI, and DLC gates; a country needs tag, definition,
history, character, flags, and ownership planning.

## Finish with evidence

Follow the sibling `hoi4-pdx-modding` **Validate proportionally** lanes.
Do not run the full validator, Mod Doctor, or a log scrape for a small
inspectable diff. User AI quota is not free.

When the change needs scripts, run the sibling validator on the edited
paths, inspect only the links those paths can break, and separate static
proof from runtime proof. After a non-trivial static pass, ask whether the
user wants AI-assisted in-game testing. If they agree and computer-use is
available, follow `workflows/test-mod.md` exactly. If they decline, provide
the smallest manual test plan and do not open Steam. Inspect-only work
does not require a Steam prompt.
