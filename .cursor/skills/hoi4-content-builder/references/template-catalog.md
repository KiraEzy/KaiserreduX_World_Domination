## Project engineering templates

These templates describe the mod being built rather than HOI4 database syntax:

| Resource | Intended use |
| --- | --- |
| `mod-technical-guide.md` | Durable architecture, identifiers, lifecycle, compatibility, and test contract |
| `development-handoff.md` | Current change state, evidence, risks, and concrete next actions |

## Boundaries

- These are structural skeletons, not globally correct gameplay defaults.
- Reuse an established project guide or handoff instead of creating duplicate
  documentation. The engineering templates are starting points only.
- The four localisation templates intentionally share the same keys. Copy each
  requested language into its matching `localisation/<language>/` directory,
  translate values only, and preserve scripted tokens, variables, icons, and
  color codes exactly. The skill instructions remain English; these files are
  player-facing output templates.
- Advanced localisation templates are demonstrations, not a single drop-in
  feature. Replace `MOD`, define `MOD_example_modifier`, and copy only entries
  whose real consumer provides the required country scope or bound parameters.
  A token being documented does not make every GUI textbox context-aware.
- `GER`, state `64`, state `999`, province `1`, and every `MOD`
  identifier are deliberate replacement markers.
- The state template is not a complete map-change kit. Follow the map/history
  workflow and verify every numeric ID.
- The on_action template uses the verified country-specific `on_weekly_TAG`
  form. Prefer an event-driven caller when the real design allows it, and never
  migrate a daily invariant merely because a weekly skeleton exists.
- The decision-category cover kit keeps a `500x200` GUI container and places an
  exact `500x220` PNG at `{ x = 5 y = -18 }`; do not resize the container to
  the texture. Keep the ordinary `<category>_desc` localisation value as one
  space so the engine does not expose a missing/empty description, and put all
  visible prose in the GUI text key. PNG support here is consumer-specific and
  does not override the DDS-only loading-screen rule.
- Recheck this table after a HOI4 update. Current vanilla consumers are the
  practical authority when generated documentation and runtime behavior differ.
- The modal kit is statically verified but still requires an in-game click test
  after it is copied, renamed, and wired to a real caller.
- The targeted-state kit is statically verified but still needs an in-game
  target-selection and both-event-options test after identifiers are replaced.
- The country generator deliberately omits flags, state ownership, OOB, focus,
  ideas, and AI. Its output is a staging scaffold, not a playable country by
  itself.
- The bookmark template's tag, labels, idea, focus, localisation, date, and
  picture are placeholders. Include only filters the intended selection UI
  needs.
- The model templates register exported resources; they do not create a mesh,
  animation rig, material, entity consumer, or graphical-culture fallback.
- Descriptor path handling differs between the launcher-side `.mod` file and a
  Workshop `descriptor.mod`; discover the real target and do not copy a local
  absolute path into a distributed descriptor.
- MIO includes, scientist traits/specializations, project tags/rewards, raid
  targets/resources, AI roles/modules, OOB IDs, faction manifests/goals/rules,
  and unit categories are version-sensitive placeholders. Replace them only
  with tokens proven in the target build and dependencies.
- The frontend kit requires full and thumbnail DDS files named exactly after
  the database/GFX registrations. PNG loading screens failed a 1.19.2 runtime
  test even when pixel-identical and correctly registered. Current vanilla DDS
  examples are 1920x1440 and 192x144 respectively. The kit deliberately does
  not override `frontendmainview.gui`.
- The named ace/operative kit uses placeholders for country tag, names, assets,
  nationality, modifiers, and localisation. Ace portraits need tag-specific
  aliases and cannot be selected directly by `add_ace`; operative portraits
  use direct `GFX`, while trait icons resolve as `GFX_trait_<trait ID>`.
- The music kit requires `music/MOD_track.ogg`. It adds a track to
  `base_music`; a custom station needs additional GUI and station resources.
- The technology/equipment kit extends the vanilla infantry-equipment archetype.
  Replace every stat, year, folder position, parent, category, localisation,
  and icon for the intended equipment family. The verified field is
  `enable_equipments` (plural), and cross-tree prerequisites use
  `dependencies = { technology = 1 }`. The kit requires
  `gfx/interface/technologies/MOD_advanced_infantry_equipment.dds` and an
  in-game technology-tree and production test.
- The game-rule kit caches the selected option one hour after `on_startup` for
  each human-controlled country. Later features should test
  `has_country_flag = MOD_content_enabled`. Rework the target set for AI-only,
  country-specific, observer, or multiplayer-host semantics; do not assume a
  global startup hook already has country scope.
