# Release a mod or skill-backed change

1. Confirm target game version, required DLCs/dependencies, supported bookmark,
   descriptor metadata, thumbnail, and `replace_path` behavior.
2. Remove sample placeholders, staging files, private paths, secrets, logs,
   caches, backups, and unrelated source assets from the release tree.
3. Run target validators, encoding checks, conflict/stale-ID searches, override
   audit, and repository diff checks. Record runtime evidence separately.
4. Ensure user-facing localisation, licenses, third-party attribution, and
   redistribution rights cover every bundled code and asset. Do not redistribute
   Paradox or third-party game assets merely because they were verification
   sources.
5. Verify the canonical technical guide, current development handoff, and code
   comments match the released implementation. Record runtime gaps honestly.
6. Package from a clean manifest with relative paths and inspect the archive
   listing before publishing. Hash the final archive and record the version.
7. Publish source and tagged releases from a repository when possible so users
   can review history and install only the intended skill/mod directories.
